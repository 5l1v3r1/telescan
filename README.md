# What is this for?
Search users in groups (and in which groups is the user) by id, username or phone number (if it's in your contacts).

# What do I need?
To use this you need a [Telegram API](https://my.telegram.org/), then edit `api_id` and `api_hash` with the ones that you previously generated.

# Limitations
To know if a user is in a group, you have to be in that group too. You can't know which users are in a specific channel if you are not an administrator.
