# What is this for?
Search users in groups (and in which groups is the user) by id, username or phone number (if it's in your contacts).

# What do I need?
To use this tool you need [Telegram API](https://my.telegram.org/) creds. After you registered a new app, edit `api_creds.ini` file accordingly.

# Usage
You need to install the requirements first.

`python3 telescan.py api_creds.ini`

# Limitations
To know if a user is in a group, you have to be in that group too. You can't know which users are in a specific channel if you are not an administrator.
